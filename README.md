# AI-Powered-Missing-Person-Detector
This is a web application built with Python and Django that helps locate missing persons using face recognition technology. Users can upload images or feed video streams from cameras, and the system automatically scans for matches in the database. Instant email notifications are sent to authorities whenever a match is found.
